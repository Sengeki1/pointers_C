for(p = primeiro; p != NULL; p = p â†’ proximo)
    free(p);

p = p->next has undefined behavior once p has been freed with free(p) 
because the object pointed to by p is no longer valid to access, 
then provide a corrected version, either as a while loop or a for loop.

p = first;
while (p != NULL) {
    struct node *next_node = p->next;
    free(p);
    p = next_node;
}

for (p = first; p != NULL; ) {
    struct node *next_node = p->next;
    free(p);
    p = next_node;
}
